**Simple White Compact** is a fork of the Simple White theme, and intends to stick very closely to the original Simple White codebase.
Simple White Compact is a mac-oriented Firefox theme that aims to simplify Firefox's appearance. With simplified color scheme, compact toolbars, and translucent tabs, Simple White Compact delivers a clean and unobtrusive UI. It is not yet available from the Mozilla Addons, but the original Simple White theme is at [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/simplewhite/).
